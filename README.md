## Overview

This repository contains the official codebase for **EoSeg** and the paper:

**Does Your ViT Still Need U-Net for Segmentation?**

The project is organized around a Lightning CLI training pipeline with dataset-specific configurations for Synapse, ACDC, GlaS, ISIC, Kvasir, and MoNuSeg.

## Main Entry

Training and evaluation are driven through `main.py` with Lightning CLI configs.

The primary experiment configuration is:

- `configs/synapse/vit_query_mul_scale_fusion.yaml`

The remaining Synapse configs are kept as ablation settings.

---

## Environment

This repository currently provides a single environment dependency file:

- `requirements.txt`

There is no `environment.yml` or `pyproject.toml` at the moment.

Recommended setup:

```bash
conda create -n eoseg python=3.10 -y
conda activate eoseg
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are running on a cluster, it is often better to install a CUDA-matched `torch` and `torchvision` first, then install the remaining packages from `requirements.txt`.

The current codebase depends on:

- `lightning` and `jsonargparse` for the CLI training pipeline
- `torch`, `torchvision`, `torchmetrics`, and `timm` for modeling and training
- `transformers` for backbone integrations
- `numpy`, `scipy`, `h5py`, `Pillow`, `matplotlib`, and `medpy` for data handling and evaluation
- `wandb` for experiment logging
- `mmengine` and `mmsegmentation` for selected backbone/util layers

---

## Training

Example training command:

```bash
python3 main.py fit --config configs/synapse/vit_query_mul_scale_fusion.yaml
```

Example evaluation command:

```bash
python3 main.py test --config configs/synapse/vit_query_mul_scale_fusion.yaml --ckpt_path /path/to/checkpoint.ckpt
```

Please update dataset paths and checkpoint paths in the YAML configs to match your local or cluster environment.

## Notes

- The repository keeps a compact set of visualization utilities under `scripts/`.
- The YAML files under `configs/synapse/` include the main model configuration plus retained ablation settings.
